# ROLEPLAY CORE RESOURCE

**This resource is currently WIP.**

## ðŸ“œ Description

This resource adds many new features to your server. Each feature is represented as a "module" so you can disable them.
**rp_core** uses a modified ox_inventory version.

## ðŸ¤– Current Features

- NPCs
  - Configure dynamic and interactive NPCs on your map. Each NPC has its own interaction options, supports blips, and can use presets like sending notifications or custom actions.
- Vehicle Rental
  - Rent vehicles at various locations. Each rental includes an NPC, a blip on the map, and multiple spawn points. Prices are calculated per minute. As a proof of rental you get a contract in your inventory.
- Shops (WIP)
  - Different shop types (e.g 24/7, LTD, Ammunation) can can be owned and filled with products of your choice. There is a default inventory if it's not owned and you can set your own prices. Watch out to refill the stock regularly.
